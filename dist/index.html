                                    Created a new developer learning guide using Confluence to accommodate the frequent contract changes and high
                                    turnover rates for developers. New additions to the development team were quickly available for implementing
                                    stories.
                                </li>

                                <li>Margin calculation enhancements: Option P&amp;L slide logic was enhanced to provide multiple scenarios per
                                    portfolio. Improved rounding accuracy when calculating for the most optimal hedging scenario. Rounding
                                    errors were causing non-optimal option hedging.</li>
                                <li>Reliability: Dramatically improved up-time, decreasing support needs. Corrected poor multithreaded
                                    programming and improper use of STL collection classes that caused nighttime jobs to fail daily and require
                                    manual intervention.</li>
                                <li>Crystal Reports/CSV exports: Enhanced reports for PortfolioMargin account aggregate requirements, Margin
                                    swing exception reports, Account excess statements and Client margin statements.</li>
                                <li>Margin Support: Provided effective technical support. Team members were responsible for one week of support
                                    – round robin across all team members. Support requirements took up about 5% of the time.</li>
                                <li>Audit compliance: Compliance with an audit requirement was achieved by ensuring all positions were accounted
                                    for within each account’s portfolio. Should a position be missed or have a different quantity after
                                    calculation, an email was automatically sent to the support team for further investigation.</li>

                            <p>v-GO SM, Passlogix’s secure kiosk product allowing users to securely access their applications without
                                exposing
                                sensitive data. Applications from one user are not accessible by any other user on that computer.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Secure Multi-User Sessions: In previous versions, any new user would cause a logout and close other user
                                    sessions. Added the capability for v-GO SM to allow multiple concurrent user sessions where user’s
                                    applications
                                    are hidden from one another to ensure security.</li>
                                <li>Transparent screen lock: In a hospital environment, doctors and nurses needed the ability to view a
                                    locked
                                    computer’s screen without the need to logon to that workstation. Designed and implemented a solution
                                    that
                                    was
                                    well under budget and completed ahead of schedule.</li>
                                <li>Technical Support: Provided effective and consistent technical support. Researched and implemented
                                    technical solutions with customers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Single Sign-on – v-GO SSO, Passlogix’s industry leading product that provides client side logon capabilities
                                automating all password management tasks including logon and password change, and providing single sign-on
                                to web sites, Windows applications, mainframe emulators and Java applications without the need for these
                                applications to call or utilize any APIs.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Performance enhancements: Response times for v-GO Single Sign-on were unacceptable due to performance
                                    requirements of one second. Response times were dramatically improved by identifying key optimization
                                    candidates
                                    using performance monitoring tools.</li>
                                <li>Smart-card Authenticator: Designed and implemented Smart-card authenticator using Windows CAPI.
                                <li>Storage Manager: Designed a multi-process data store forcing all processes to utilize the same address
                                    space
                                    allowing the shared memory to be distributed via a heap.</li>
                                <li>Mainframe Helper Object: Redesigned v-GO Single Sign-On access to mainframe applications to utilize a
                                    data-driven solution that supported a much wider range of mainframe emulators significantly reducing the
                                    requirement to involve developers in critical support resolution scenarios. This allowed field engineers
                                    to instantly support new mainframe emulators.</li>
                                <li>Command prompt HLLAPI driver: Quickly designed a HLLAPI based driver for cmd.exe to accept Single
                                    Sign-on requests. This involved injecting a DLL into cmd.exe and utilizing the same DLL from within three
                                    different processes.</li>
                                <li>Resolved frequent crashes: Added a crash handler that would report faults and stack traces in the
                                    application
                                    and allow the application to continue running. These stack traces were monumental in diagnosing customer
                                    reported defects that could not be reproduced in-house.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Data Access Layer (DAL): Component designed to use hard coded classes to represent logical data definitions
                                    consisting of multiple tables and a hard coded where clause. Redesigned to move the data definitions to tables
                                    within the database which allowed for more rapid development. Definitions of SQL tables were stored in DAL
                                    tables which were used to construct SQL statements.</li>
                                <li>Java Data Access Layer (JDAL): When Microsoft was unable to continue supporting Java, the C++ DAL was rewritten
                                    in Java 2 using JDBC.</li>
                                <li>Entitlements Engine: Utilizing the DAL, all database access incorporated entitlements checking into their

                    <p>Apart from being a developer, I enjoy playing 8-ball and 9-ball plaing on leagues and recreationally.
                        I ride a Harley Davidson Wide Glide and love the sharp turns throughout Harriman State Park.  I especially enjoy
                        the fall when the leaves begin to change color.  
                        In the winter, I like to go snowboarding and always enjoy a smooth carve.  
                        While on vacations in the Carribean, I always try to do a few scuba dives with Eden Rock 
                        in the Cayman Islands being my favorite dive location.
                        I also love dogs, with Vizslas being my faviorite breed.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I also like to spend my free time giving back to the community and volunteer as an Emergency 
                        Medical Technician.  I find extreme satisfaction in being able to help people.
